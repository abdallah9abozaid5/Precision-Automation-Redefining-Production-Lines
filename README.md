# Precision-Automation-Redefining-Production-Lines
Precision Automation is a smart production line project featuring a 5-DOF robotic arm and conveyor system for height-based sorting. Using IR sensors, Arduino control, and a lightweight 3D-printed ABS arm, the system performs reliable pick-and-place operations automatically with high accuracy and low cost.
